=============

This contains the source code for GCNDatagramScriptStarter. This is part of the gamma ray burst first hour followup software. It takes GCN datagram packets (generated by GCN_Server from packets received from the GCN network), filters the packets by various criteria, and if the packet matches the criteria, invokes a script (gamma_ray_burst_alert) to trigger a gamma ray burst followup on the telescope.
